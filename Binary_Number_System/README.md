## Decimal to Binary Conversion

### How It Works:
To convert a decimal number to binary:
1. Divide the decimal number by 2.
2. Record the remainder.
3. Repeat until the quotient is 0.
4. Write the remainders in reverse order.

### Example:
Convert decimal `10` to binary:
10 ÷ 2 = 5, Remainder = 0
5 ÷ 2 = 2, Remainder = 1
2 ÷ 2 = 1, Remainder = 0
1 ÷ 2 = 0, Remainder = 1

Binary: 1010
