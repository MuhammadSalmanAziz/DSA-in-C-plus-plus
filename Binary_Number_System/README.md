## Introduction to Binary Number System

The binary number system is a **base-2 number system** that uses only two digits: `0` and `1`. It is the foundation of all modern digital systems, including computers, calculators, and microcontrollers.

## Binary to Decimal Conversion

### How It Works:
Each digit in a binary number represents a power of 2, starting from 2‚Å∞ on the right.

### Example:
Convert binary `1010` to decimal:

## Decimal to Binary Conversion

### How It Works:
To convert a decimal number to binary:
1. Divide the decimal number by 2.
2. Record the remainder.
3. Repeat until the quotient is 0.
4. Write the remainders in reverse order.

### Example:
Convert decimal `10` to binary:
- 10 √∑ 2 = 5, Remainder = 0
- 5 √∑ 2 = 2, Remainder = 1
- 2 √∑ 2 = 1, Remainder = 0
- 1 √∑ 2 = 0, Remainder = 1

Binary: 1010

## 1's Complement

1's complement is obtained by flipping all the bits in a binary number:
- Change `0` to `1` and `1` to `0`.

### Example:
Binary `1010` ‚Üí 1's Complement: `0101`

---

## 2's Complement

2's complement is used to represent negative numbers in binary. It is calculated by:
1. Taking the 1's complement of the number.
2. Adding `1` to the result.

### Example:
Binary `1010`:
1. 1's Complement: `0101`
2. Add `1`: `0101 + 1 = 0110`

Result: `0110`
