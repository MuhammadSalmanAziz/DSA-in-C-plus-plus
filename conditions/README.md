C++ Conditions Explained

Welcome to the C++ Conditions Guide! This repository is a quick and beginner-friendly resource to understand the different types of conditions in C++ programming. Mastering conditions is essential for writing logical and decision-based programs. Dive in and explore!

🌟 What are Conditions in C++?

Conditions in C++ allow us to make decisions based on specific criteria. Using conditions, you can:

Execute different code blocks depending on the outcome of a test.

Handle various scenarios dynamically during runtime.

🛠️ Common Types of Conditions in C++:

if Statements

if-else Statements

else-if Ladder

Nested if Statements

Switch Case Statements

Ternary (Conditional) Operator

🧑‍💻 Examples and Syntax

1. if Statement

The simplest form of a condition:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int age = 18;

    if (age >= 18) {
        cout << "You are eligible to vote!" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

Explanation: Executes the block if the condition age >= 18 is true.

2. if-else Statement

Handles two possibilities:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int age = 16;

    if (age >= 18) {
        cout << "You are eligible to vote!" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "You are not eligible to vote yet." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

Explanation: Executes one block if the condition is true and another if it is false.

3. else-if Ladder

Checks multiple conditions sequentially:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int score = 85;

    if (score >= 90) {
        cout << "Grade: A" << endl;
    } else if (score >= 80) {
        cout << "Grade: B" << endl;
    } else if (score >= 70) {
        cout << "Grade: C" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Grade: F" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

Explanation: Evaluates conditions from top to bottom and executes the first true block.

4. Nested if Statements

Conditions inside conditions:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num = 10;

    if (num > 0) {
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
            cout << "The number is positive and even." << endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

Explanation: The inner if block executes only if the outer condition is true.

5. Switch Case Statement

Efficient for handling multiple constant values:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    char grade = 'B';

    switch (grade) {
        case 'A':
            cout << "Excellent!" << endl;
            break;
        case 'B':
            cout << "Good job!" << endl;
            break;
        case 'C':
            cout << "Well done." << endl;
            break;
        default:
            cout << "Invalid grade." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

Explanation: Tests the variable grade against multiple cases.

6. Ternary Operator

A compact alternative to if-else:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 20;
    string result = (a > b) ? "a is greater" : "b is greater";
    cout << result << endl;
    return 0;
}

Explanation: Evaluates (a > b) and assigns the result based on the condition.
