## Why Learn DSA in C++?

- **Efficient Memory Management:** C++ provides low-level memory manipulation, making it ideal for implementing DSA.
- **Fast Execution:** C++ is one of the fastest programming languages, crucial for competitive programming.
- **STL Support:** C++ Standard Template Library (STL) simplifies implementation of many data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures

### Linear Data Structures:
1. **Arrays**
   - Fixed-size collections of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
   - Ideal for fast data retrieval using indices.
   - **Use Case:** Storing and accessing elements with constant time complexity.

   Example: Find the maximum element in an array.  
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   int main() {
       int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
       int max = arr[0];
       for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
           if (arr[i] > max)
               max = arr[i];
       }
       cout << "Maximum Element: " << max << endl;
       return 0;
   }```

2. **Linked List**  
   - A collection of nodes where each node points to the next.
   - Dynamic in size, making them efficient for insertions and deletions.
   - **Use Case:** Implementing stacks, queues, or memory-efficient lists.


3. **Stack**  
   - A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure.
   - Operations: `push()`, `pop()`, and `peek()`.
   - **Use Case:** Undo functionality in applications, expression evaluation.
  
4. **Queue**  
   - A first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure.
   - Types: Simple queue, circular queue, and priority queue.
   - **Use Case:** Task scheduling and handling asynchronous requests.
